    <p><b>Re: Request for Permission to Conduct MuMent - Evening Club</b></p>

    <p>Dear Sir,</p>
    <p>
        I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to seek your permission to establish an evening club named MuMent under the auspices of MuLearn STI at our esteemed institution, St. Thomas Institute of Science and Technology.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
    <p>
        MuMent is an initiative where students can come together to form small learning circles, consisting of a maximum of five members each. These circles will be based on shared interests, enabling participants to upskill in their chosen domains through a self-learning approach. The primary platform for this initiative will be the MuLearn STI Discord channel, which will facilitate communication and coordination among members.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Learning and Assessment</b></p>
    <p>
        Participants will be required to show proof of their work and progress through the Discord channel. Each task submitted will be verified by a designated mentor, and upon approval, participants will earn Karma points. These points will serve as a motivational tool and a measure of each student's engagement and progress.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Request for Approval</b></p>
    <p>
        In light of the above, I kindly request your permission to conduct MuMent at our institute. I firmly believe that this initiative will foster a collaborative learning environment, enhance skill development, and ultimately contribute to the holistic growth of our students.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am happy to provide any further information you might require and discuss this proposal in more detail at your convenience.
    </p>
    
    <p>Thank you for considering this request.</p>
    
    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
    <p>
        Muhammed Ziyan<br>
        Campus Lead<br>
        MuLearn STI
